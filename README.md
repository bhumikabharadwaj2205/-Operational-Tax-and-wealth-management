# 🧾 Operational Tax Reporting Optimization in Wealth Management using Power BI, Power Query, DAX

> A  project to modernize tax reporting operations for FATCA compliance using Power BI.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can optimize **operational tax reporting** in wealth management, particularly under complex global regulations such as **FATCA** and **CRS**. Using **Power BI**, the dashboard centralizes compliance data, allowing teams to monitor risks, assess filing behavior, and streamline tax reporting processes.

## 📌 Business Problem

Wealth management firms face difficulty meeting FATCA/CRS requirements due to:

- Fragmented systems  
- Manual workflows  
- Regulatory complexity  
- Poor compliance visibility

This dashboard addresses those challenges with a **centralized, real-time, interactive** analytics solution.

## 📊 Key KPIs (Important Numbers We Track)

These KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) help us understand how well the tax reporting process is working, and where we need to improve.

| KPI Name                | What It Tells Us |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Filed Report %**      | How many clients have submitted their tax reports on time. |
| **Average Compliance Score** | A score (from 0 to 100) that shows how well clients are following tax rules. |
| **Automation Usage %**  | How many cases are handled by automated tools instead of manually. |
| **Late Filing %**       | The percentage of reports that were submitted after the deadline. |
| **High-Risk Clients**   | How many clients are considered risky because of errors or missing reports. |
| **Average Processing Time** | How long it takes (on average) to process a report. |

🧠 **Why These Matter Together**:
- They help spot problems early (like late reports or risky clients)
- Show if automation is helping the team work faster
- Make it easier to decide where to focus attention (like which clients or regions need help)
- Help the company stay compliant and avoid penalties
